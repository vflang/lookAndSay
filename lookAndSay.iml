/* Planning:
Prompt: Look and Say sequence:

                                    1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
                                    11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21
                                    21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211
                                    first six numbers: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211

 - and so on--print out results up until the six one; use a for loop;
        for (int i = 1; i<=6;i++)
 - need a counter for the numbers; could set up a thing where it's like it tests if the numbers are similar to each other??
    because just counting how many 2's and 1's there are won't work.
 - use count++? for the digit; have to use some sort of conversion from int to string
 - need some sort of boolean factor i suppose to make the program differenciate from the previous and current number.
 - case/if and else for if it equals 1? 2 and 3 and so on i mean it's just the first 6 not sure how to do more.
 - treat it as a string? use a switch statement? count the nubmers as string


                                           possible ways to do this maybe:
 - treat it as a string and make the program read one character at a time through a for loop (so if there's one 2, print 1 etc)
        *edit: yeah how exactly am I supposed to do that there's this charAt thing but that's for the alphabet
 - use ints but the problem is if the answer is set to the output then the program recognizes it as a double number, not single digits
 Ahh


 following info is observed from reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39823137/java-count-the-number-of-integers-in-a-string

 - now see here this was what i was talking about the count++ but I didn't know how to format it.
 - except they have this "boolean isPreviousDigit = false;" which is for more than 6 numbers?
